					<p>My name is Ron D. Osborne and I’m a former Collegiate Football Player and High School Track Athlete. I have always been passionate about fitness and at one point in my life I aspired to become a Bodybuilder.</p>
					<p>I ended up pursuing a different career path and held Sales and Customer Service Positions with Information Technology Companies. Never really satisfied with that career choice I decided to pursue a career in Fitness again and got my first certification from the AFPA in October of 2010.</p>
					<p>I have since earned a certification from the ASFA and also a CPR/AED Certification from the American Health Care Academy. I believe in positive reinforcement with a firm but non-commando approach to fitness. We take pride in the success of our clients.</p>
					<p>Fitness like cooking is a recipe for life and everything is a work in progress.</p>

                        <p>Ron has a way of encouraging you with his upbeat spirit and believing you can do more than you think you can, so you start believing it yourself! It doesn't matter if you are new in the class or have been around for awhile, his constant excitement for his students to keep moving safely is shown through his smiles, laughter, and you've got this attitude!</p>

                        <p>I have been working with Ron for almost a year. During that time he has shown me through instruction and example what it means to work for your goals. He understands how to prescribe or modify the exercises for my ability and physical state at any given time. He has a gentle way to correct my form so I get the most out of what I am doing. The work outs are fun yet challenging. He always knows when to give an encouraging word just when it is needed.</p>

                        <img src="img/testimonial-4.jpg" class="img-circle" alt="">
                        <p>Ron’s boot camp focuses on a variety of core and balance exercises; traditional exercises (bench press, lunges, curls, etc.), along with newer exercise combinations (ropes, kettle bell, resistance bands, etc.) which engage various muscle groups to achieve the best workout possible. The routines vary from class to class so the workout is never monotonous or boring. The workouts are tailored to fit your skill level, which is paramount not only for the advanced classes but also those new to the boot camp experience or exercising in general.</p>
						<p>Throughout the workout, Ron focuses his attention on each person in the class to make sure they achieve maximum results. He has the ability to inspire and motivate people throughout the class, but does so without making you feel uncomfortable or inferior. He understands that we all exercise at different levels and modifies each routine accordingly.</p>
						<p>As someone who has been involved in health and fitness for over 25 years, I find it refreshing to encounter someone that takes pride in the progress of their students and shows that he truly cares about the individuals in the class not just how many people he can get to attend. I encourage anyone to take Ron’s boot camp and experience the difference that he makes.</p>

                        <p>***In the year that I have been taking bootcamp with Ron we have NEVER done the same workout twice. You can tell that he takes considerable time preparing for each class regularly introducing new exercises and/or combination of exercises that continue to challenge us and improve our overall strength and endurance. ***With each class you are guaranteed a full body workout. The perfect mix of strength training combined with cardio. You will leave everything on the floor. You will be sweaty, your muscles fatigued – and yet amazingly, you feel invigorated. ***Ron is a stickler about proper form to ensure that we are getting the most out of each exercise and more importantly to prevent unnecessary injury. He demonstrates each new exercise before we do it and is known to walk around the room to correct individuals as necessary. ***Ron is a gentle giant, but don’t let that fool you. He is highly motivating and constantly pushes you to achieve your personal best. ***Despite the number of people in the bootcamp class, you always get individual attention from Ron - correction on form, the push you need to complete an exercise, praise for progress no matter how big or small. ***Ron regularly seeks feedback from the participants to make sure that the class continues to meet their needs and expectations. ***I am thrilled with my results from taking Ron’s bootcamp! I am physically stronger and can do exercises today that I never thought possible. My body is stronger, leaner and more fit than ever before.</p>
